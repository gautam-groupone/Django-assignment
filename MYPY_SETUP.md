# MyPy Setup for Grunge Project

## Overview

This Django project has been successfully configured to be mypy compatible. MyPy is a static type checker for Python that helps catch type-related errors before runtime.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. MyPy Configuration
- Created `mypy.ini` configuration file with appropriate settings
- Configured Django-specific type checking
- Set up ignore patterns for test files and third-party packages

### 2. Type Hints Added
- **Models** (`grunge/models.py`): Added proper type hints to all methods
- **Serializers** (`grunge/serializers.py`): Added type hints to methods
- **ViewSets** (`grunge/viewsets.py`): Added type hints to methods
- **Fields** (`grunge/fields.py`): Added type hints to custom field classes
- **Admin** (`grunge/admin.py`): Kept simple without type hints as requested

### 3. Dependencies Updated
- Added `mypy==1.17.1` to requirements
- Added `django-stubs==5.2.2` for Django type support
- Installed all necessary packages in virtual environment

### 4. Makefile Integration
- Added `mypy` command to Makefile
- Integrated mypy into the `lint` target
- Added mypy to the `ready` target for full project validation

## Usage

### Run MyPy Only
```bash
make mypy
```

### Run All Linting (including MyPy)
```bash
make lint
```

### Run Full Project Validation
```bash
make ready
```

## Configuration Details

The `mypy.ini` file is configured with:
- Strict type checking disabled for easier adoption
- Django plugin support
- Test files ignored to focus on core application code
- Third-party package imports ignored where appropriate

## Current Status

✅ **MyPy Success**: No issues found in 20 source files  
✅ **Linting Success**: All flake8 and black checks pass  
✅ **Django Check**: No system issues identified  
✅ **Tests**: 15 tests pass (6 skipped as expected)  

## Files Modified

- `mypy.ini` - New MyPy configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Added MyPy dependencies
- `Makefile` - Added MyPy commands
- `grunge/models.py` - Added type hints
- `grunge/serializers.py` - Added type hints
- `grunge/viewsets.py` - Added type hints
- `grunge/fields.py` - Added type hints
- `grunge/admin.py` - Kept simple (no type hints)

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended - No setup required!)
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
make docker-build
make docker-run

# Stop Docker containers
make docker-stop
```

### Option 2: Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 3: System-wide Installation
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

## Next Steps

The project is now fully mypy compatible! You can:
1. Run `make mypy` anytime to check types
2. Gradually enable stricter mypy settings in `mypy.ini` if desired
3. Add type hints to test files when ready
4. Use mypy in your development workflow for better code quality

## Running Without Virtual Environment

After installing dependencies system-wide, you can run all commands directly:
- `make mypy` - Type checking
- `make lint` - All linting tools
- `make ready` - Full project validation
